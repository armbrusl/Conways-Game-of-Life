# Conways Game of Life

In order for this code to work add the header file (olcPixelGameEngine.h) found at https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine.
<br /> <br />

Commands one can use so far:

* **Left Click (Hold)** &rarr; Shows the number of neighboors of the selected cell (N=..) and a window that shows a zoomed in version of the neighboors of the selected cell. Above the "smaller" zoomed in window we have (X-Coordinate - Y-Coordinate - "Zoom Level"). The "Zoom Level" can be 3, 4, 5, or 6. <br />


* **Left Click (Hold)** +  **Right Click (Hold)** &rarr; Change the value of the selected grid to Alive. <br />
* **Left Click (Hold)** +  **Mouse Roll Up** &rarr; Zoom in. <br />
* **Left Click (Hold)** +  **Mouse Roll Down** &rarr; Zoom out. <br /> <br />

* **U Button (Hold)** &rarr; Progress the time Forwards. <br />
* **R Button (Pressed)** &rarr; Progress the time Backwards. Only by one step because I do not keep track of the past grids. <br />
* **I Button (Pressed)** &rarr; Resets the entire grid. <br /> <br />

* **P Button (Hold)** +  **Right Click (Pressed)** &rarr; Insert a "Glider Gun". <br /> 
* **G Button (Hold)** + **X Button (Hold)** +  **Right Click (Pressed)** &rarr; Insert a Glider of type X (I do not know the name). <br /> 
* **G Button (Hold)** + **Y Button (Hold)** +  **Right Click (Pressed)** &rarr; Insert a Glider of type Y (I do not know the name). <br />
