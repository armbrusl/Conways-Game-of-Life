# Conways Game of Life
by armbrusl <br />

I created this project in an effort to get people interested in olc::PixelGameEngine while also giving them an existing template to work on. <br /> <br />

Commands one can use so far:

* **Left Click (Hold)** &rarr; Shows the number of neighboors of the selected cell (N=..) and a window that shows a zoomed in version of the neighboors of the selected cell. <br />


* **Left Click (Hold)** +  **Right Click (Hold)** &rarr; Change the value of the selected grid to its opposite. That is (Alive &rarr; Dead and Dead &rarr; Alive). <br />
* **Left Click (Hold)** +  **Mouse Roll Up** &rarr; Zoom in. <br />
* **Left Click (Hold)** +  **Mouse Roll Down** &rarr; Zoom out. <br /> <br />

* **U Button (Hold)** &rarr; Progress the time Forwards. <br />
* **R Button (Pressed)** &rarr; Progress the time Backwards. Only by one step because I do not keep track of the past grids. <br />
