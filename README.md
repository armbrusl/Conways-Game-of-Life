I created this project in an effort to get people interested in olc::PixelGameEngine while also giving them an existing template to work on. <br /> <br />

Commands one can use so far:

Left Click (Hold) -> Shows the number of neighboors of the selected cell (N=..) and a window that shows a zoomed in version of the neighboors of the selected cell. <br />
