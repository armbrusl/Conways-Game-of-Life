I created this project in an effort to create a userfriendly enviroment and learning experience for people who want to learn to use olc::PixelGameEngine. <br /> <br />

Commands one can use so far:

Left Click (Hold) -> Shows the number of neighboors of the selected cell (N=..) and a window that shows a zoomed in version of the neighboors of the selected cell. <br />
